# Campaign-effect-on-voter-turnout.-
An analysis on the relevance of various covariates on voter turnout and the effect of campaign methods alongside these variables on candidate selection.

The paper goes into great detail on the relevance and magnitude of effect of the individual variables, incorporating some interaction terms. 

While the findings are intutive, we quantify the effect of sending pamphlets to potential voters, 
calling them among others and this facilitates a cost benefit analysis with respect to campaign strategy for politicians.
